# How to Download and Extract Files in Python: A Guide for Developers

Handling file downloads and extraction is a common requirement for many developers. Whether you're working on a data processing project, a web application, or any other kind of software, chances are you'll need to fetch and manipulate files at some point. In this blog, we'll dive into a Python script that demonstrates how to download files from the internet, save them temporarily, and extract their contents. Let's explore this handy functionality step by step.

## The Code

Let's begin by examining the key components of our script:

```python
import os
import sys
from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile
from urllib.request import urlopen
from urllib.parse import unquote, urlparse
from urllib.error import HTTPError
from zipfile import ZipFile
import tarfile
import shutil

CHUNK_SIZE = 40960
DATA_SOURCE_MAPPING = '<URLs>'

```

This code snippet imports necessary Python libraries for handling file operations, making HTTP requests, and extracting file archives. It sets up a `CHUNK_SIZE` for buffering file downloads and initializes `DATA_SOURCE_MAPPING` placeholder for source URLs.

### Step by Step Functionality

1. **Importing Libraries**:
    
    Our script relies on standard libraries:
    
    - `os` and `sys` for interacting with the operating system.
    - `NamedTemporaryFile` from `tempfile` for creating temporary files.
    - `urlopen` for opening URLs.
    - `unquote` and `urlparse` for parsing URLs.
    - `HTTPError` for catching HTTP error statuses.
    - `ZipFile` for working with ZIP archives.
    - `tarfile` for handling TAR files.
    - `shutil` for high-level file operations.
2. **Setting Constants**:
    
    `CHUNK_SIZE` specifies the size of each chunk of data read from a file or internet resource. It's set to 40960 bytes, which is a reasonable size for reading large files without consuming too much memory.
    
3. **Data Source Mapping**:
    
    `DATA_SOURCE_MAPPING` is a placeholder to store URLs of the files you want to download. Replace `<URLs>` with actual URLs or a collection of URLs you'll work with.
